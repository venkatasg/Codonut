# Codonut

A simple educational game that aims to teach the concept of codon bias. I developed the game as part of iGEM 2016 by Team IIT Madras. You can download the game on the [App Store](http://www.appstore.com/Codonut) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.igemiitm.codonut).
